# Document-Retrieval--using-kmeans--clustering
It contains Document Retrieval system that uses Wikipedia dataset for implementing intelligent document retirieval using k-means clustering.

We perform three tasks :

1.  Compare top words according to word counts to TF-IDF :
Take a particular famous person, 'Elton John'. What are the 3 words in his articles with highest word counts?
What are the 3 words in his articles with highest TF-IDF?
These results illustrate why TF-IDF is useful for finding important words.

2. Measuring distance between selected people from dataset.

3. Building nearest neighbors models with different input features and setting the distance metric: 
In the sample notebook, we built a nearest neighbors model for retrieving articles using TF-IDF as features and using the default setting in the construction of the nearest neighbors model.
Now, we build two nearest neighbors models
